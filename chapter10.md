Lecture 10: Company Culture and Building a Team, Part I 

I'll set the stage with some slides and a few comments but the main stage is going to be with Brian when he comes up and talks about how he built the AirBnB culture. So, you are here, you have been following the presentations, so you know how to get started. You have built a team, you know how to build your product, it’s off the ground, it's growing. People love it, you figured out how to do that. You figured out to create a special one of a kind company with monopoly powers, that’s big. And the market you are chasing after is slightly bigger than the paper airplane business, so you are good, right? So now what?

我會以幻燈片與一些個人見解來開頭
但是這次主要是與Brian一起
討論一下他是怎樣
建立起AirBnB文化的
你們在這裡
已經聽了上面的報告
你們應該知道了怎樣開始
已經組建了一個團隊
你知道瞭如何構建你的產品
它已經落實正在成長
你已經知道如何讓人們喜歡它
你已經知道
用壟斷力量去創造一個特別的獨一無二的企業
都是宏大目標
你正在追逐的市場
比紙飛機行業稍微又大了點
所以你已經很棒了對吧
現在該做什麼呢

So we are here to submit that actually culture is the thing that is actually going to be very, very important to scale the business as well as your team. And hopefully, after this talk you will be able to know: What is culture? Why does it matter? How do you create your core values? And think about elements that fit together for core values and culture that create a high performance team. Get some best practices for the culture.

所以我們在這裡主張事實上
文化對公司的業務與團隊的擴張
非常非常重要
但願這個講座過後你會了解到
什麼是文化？
為什麼它如此重要？
你是怎樣創造你的核心價值的？
然後再想想能夠為了能創造表現優良的團隊
所需要的核心價值與文化
需要匯聚哪些元素
為了這種文化大膽地去實踐吧

What is culture? Anybody want to take a guess at how one should define this? {Simple values in a team?} Yeah, that’s good. Did you look that up because you had a computer and an internet connection? These are some definitions that you will find in Webster’s dictionary but we are Stanford. This is kind of a trick question. It’s a CS class, the questions are never straight forward.

什麼是文化？
有誰想要猜一猜
如何定義它嗎
團隊中一系列價值觀？
對非常好
你剛剛有去檢索過嗎
因為你有一台電腦和互聯網連接
你是網上搜的嗎
這些是一些
可以在韋氏詞典中找到的解釋
但是我們在斯坦福
這是個有些陷阱的問題這是計算機科學課程
問題從來不會那樣簡單直接

The real question is, what is the company culture going to be. Culture, we can generally talk about society, about groups, about places, or things. Here we're talking about company culture. So how does one define company culture? We can take the previous definition and modify it a little bit. This is a hint of how we may want to define company culture. Every day blank and blank of each member of the team in pursuit of our company blank. Some people have filled these in with different things. The first blank, A, could be assumptions, beliefs, values, now my favorite is core values. The second blank for the B blank, people said behavior, my favorite is action. How do you act? In pursuit of goals, that’s kind of weak, in pursuit of big and hairy audacious goals is a little stronger, but a better definition is in the pursuit of mission.

真正的問題在於
公司文化將會變成什麼樣
關於文化我們可以大致地談論社會
談論群體地點或者其他事物
在這裡我們在談論有關公司文化
所以究竟要如何定義公司文化呢？
我們可以採用之前的定義但是做出一些改動
所以這暗示著
每天我們想如何定義公司文化
每個團隊成員的什麼和什麼
為了追究我們公司的什麼
一些人會用不同的東西填充
這些空白
第一個空白A 可以是假設信仰價值觀
我最喜歡的是核心價值觀
第二個B空白
人們說是行為
但是我的最愛是真實行動\N61\N00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,​​020\N你是如何行動的\N62\N00:02:26,​​590 --> 00:02:29,510\N為了達到目標這麼說似乎有點弱
為了達到驚險大膽的大目標
這樣更強一些
更好的定義是在追求使命過程中
那麼現在我們有定義了


So now that we have that definition, what do we do with that and why does it matter? This is a quote from Gandhi “Your beliefs become your thoughts. Your thoughts become your words. Your words become your actions. Your actions become the habits. Your habits become your values. And your values become your destiny.” If you don't have a good culture in the company you can’t pursue your destiny.

我們該如何去做呢
並且為什麼它很重要呢
這裡有一段甘地語錄的選段
你的信仰成為你的思想
你的思想成為你的語言
你的語言成為你的行動
你的行動成為你的習慣
你的習慣成為你的價值觀
你的價值觀成為你的命運
如果你沒有一個良好的公司文化
你就無法追逐你的命運

Why it matters is that it becomes the first principles you sort of go back to when you make decisions. It becomes a way to align people on values that matter to the company. It provides a certain level of stability to fall back on. And it provides level of trust, people sort of trust each other with, but it also gives us a list with which you should be able to figure out what to do and what not to do. And what the more important thing about that is what not to do. Then finally the other thing that is important is it allows you to retain the right employees. There are people in this world that are not going to be a fit for your company, but if you have good strong culture, and the strong core values, you'll know who you want to retain and who you truly do not want to retain. And if you take the first letter of those it happens to help you move faster.

它重要是因為
它是當你做決定時
要引用的首要準則
它變成了在公司重要價值基礎上上
聯合人員的方式
它提供了可以轉而依靠的穩定性
它還提供了信任
讓人們可以相互信任
它也給你一張表單告訴你什麼該做
什麼不該做
二者中更重要的是什麼不應該做
最後另一件很重要的事情是
它讓你保留合適的僱員
在這個世界上就有一些人
不適合繼續留在你的公司裡
但是如果你有強有力的文化
強有力的核心價值
你會知道你想要留誰
不想留下誰
如果你把這些詞的首字母連起來
正好就是幫助你和公司發展得更快

Another reason, you're thinking that's like all mushy stuff, this is actually more scientific stuff. So here are indices from 1994 to 2013, stock market indices of companies in the S&P500, and the Russell 3000, and the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For. All these companies out there and they picked out companies that they believed were the best companies to work for. The stock market returns of those companies happen to be 11.8%, which is almost twice that of the other two indices. And so there is real power in companies that treat their employees well, where there's a lot of trust, there is a lot of strong culture.

另一個原因是
你覺得那些都是感性的東西
而這些更多的偏向科學證據
這裡是從1994到2013的
美國500家上市公司的標準普爾指數
羅素3000指數
和最佳去處財富前100強公司
他們調查了所有這些公司
並選出了他們所認為的
就業選擇最好的公司還有回報率
那些公司的股票市場回報率剛好是11.08%
差不多是其他兩項指數的兩倍
所以在具有很強的信任和
很強的企業文化的公司它們對待員工
的確是有很強的實力的

So how do you create a set of values and define the culture etc? Get asked that a lot. You have to start with the leader of the company and the founder, and ask yourself what are the values that are the most important to you? Of those things, that are most important in the business? Who are the types of people you like working with? And what are their values? And through that you distill together what a set of values are. Think about all the people that you've never liked working with. What values do they have? Think of the opposite of that. Maybe those should be considered values for your company. Finally remember the values have to support your mission and if they don't support your mission, you’re missing something. Then the last final checks are they have to be creditable, they have to be uniquely tied to match your mission. So at Zappos, in terms of uniquely applied to the mission, we were focused on creating a culture that was going to provide great customer service. So the first core value we had, was to deliver wow through service. We are very specific that we wanted to deliver great customer service and it was going to be a wow experience. And then below that we wanted to serve.

所以你如何創造一系列價值觀並定義文化等事呢
我經常被問到那個問題
你必須先從公司領導即創始人開始
捫心自問
對你來說最重要的個人價值觀是什麼？
對企業來說最重要的事情有哪些？
你喜歡與之共事的人是什麼類型的？
他們的價值觀是什麼？
通過這些你再提取一系列價值觀的精華
然後想想你不喜歡共事的人是什麼樣的
他們的價值觀是什麼？
從反面思考一下
那些可能就是你的公司要考慮的價值觀
最後要記住價值觀應該支持你的使命
如果它不能支持你的使命
你就漏掉了什麼
然後最後是檢查它們是否可信
應當與你的使命唯一聯繫
所以在Zappos
為了獨特地綁定使命
我們的核心是創造一種
將會提供偉大的消費者體驗的文化
所以我們的首要核心價值觀是
通過服務傳遞"哇哦"
我們非常明確我們要向消費者
傳遞很棒的服務那將是一個令人“哇哦”的驚喜體驗
其次的價值觀是我們希望

I had a paragraph talking about what we mean by that, we wanted to support them, doing the wow through service, and support people such as our employees, our customers, our brand partners, and investors. On terms of the opposite thing, we generally didn’t like working with arrogant people, so one of our core values at Zappos was to be humble. So those are two examples where we create core values in a way that became credible and uniquely tied to our mission.

我有一張圖標來明確表現
我們的意思
我們想要支持他們
通過服務傳遞"哇哦"
支持我們的員工
我們的消費者我們的品牌合作商我們的投資人
而對於相反的一面
我們普遍不喜歡與傲慢的人一起共事
所以我們在Zappos的核心價值觀之一就是謙虛
所以那些就是我們為了創造可信的
與我們的使命緊密結合的核心價值觀的兩個例子

So you go through this process, you come up with a few core values, these might be some of them, whether it's honesty, integrity, service, teamwork. It might be a list, you might start with three, might end up with a list of ten, you might have a list of thirty. It’s a good start. When Zappos went through this process we asked all the employees at the time what core values they can identify with and they came up with thirty-seven. We whittled that down to about ten. And it took a year to do this, that's a long time and you might want to ask why. Well if you just come up with the word honesty, give me a break, everybody wants the culture to be honest, nobody is going to say I want to be lied to every day.

所以當你經歷這段過程時
你會想到一些核心價值觀
可能就是這些
比如誠實正直服務團隊合作
它可能是個清單
你可以從3個開始以10個結束
你可能有30個
是個好的開始
當Zappos經歷這個過程時我們開始時
問了所有的僱員他們想認同什麼樣的
核心價值觀他們想出來37個
我們將那些縮減到了大約10個
為了做這件事情花費了一年
時間很長你們可能想問為什麼
如果你想出了誠實這個單詞
我是說別逗了
每個人都希望文化是誠實的
沒有人會說我想每天都被人欺騙

Service, what do you mean by service? There’s got to be a lot more depth in this than that. And everybody talks about teamwork, but there's a difference in level of teamwork that you see in an intramural sports team vs a baseball team. How do you dive deeper into teamwork? What are the things that don't work for a team? A lot of it has to do with communication, a lot has to do with things that people of study, and you may one go deeper into that. At Zappos we thought about, well there are a lot of smart people in this room. When they're fighting with each other and trying to figure out who's right and who's not, it’s probably not the best use of time. We wanted everyone to build off each other and help each other make any idea better. The result is that the company gets a better idea, not that any individual person is right. So we wanted to make and still, this idea that it's company first, then your department, then your the team, then yourself. And how do you do that?

服務你想表達什麼意思呢
這個詞背後一定有更深層次的東西
每個人都在討論團隊合作
但是你看到的在校內運動隊
與棒球隊團隊合作的程度是不一樣的
所以你如何深挖團隊合作？
對於團隊來說什麼是不適合的？
許多都與溝通有關
許多東西與人們學習的內容有關
你可能會想要對它了解更多
在Zappos我們想
在這裡有這麼多聰明的人
當他們相互爭吵
為了弄清誰對誰錯
這恐怕不是利用時間的好方式
我們希望所有人都能互相幫助
幫助讓想法變得更好
這樣公司就能得到更好的創意
而不是哪個人是對的
所以我們希望灌輸
把公司放在第一位的理念
然後才是你的部門再然後是團隊最後是自己
怎樣才能做到呢？

We are going to go a level deeper in that. There's another great element of high performing teams that I really like. Which is this pyramid that was created by Patrick Lencioni, and he wrote this book, “The Five Dysfunctions of a Team.” And the reason this is interesting is he talks about the breakdowns of the team. A lot of teams break down because they have no trust and even if you had trust, why do you need trust? If you have trust, you can actually have debates and conflict and get to the right answer. If you don't have conflicts and debate, it's the blind leading the blind. How do you actually know you got to the right answer before you commit to something? So people are not actually wanting to commit, they're afraid of committing.

為了深入說一說
還有另外一個
我特別喜歡的高效團隊的特點
就是Patrick Lencioni創造的金字塔
他寫過一本書叫團隊的五大障礙
他的觀點有趣的原因是
他講述了團隊是怎麼破裂的
首先如果你不
很多團隊破裂是因為他們之間沒有信任
即使你們有信任那信任為什麼是必須的？
如果你們之間有信任你才能
互相爭論然後得出正確的答案
如果你們之間沒有衝突和爭論
這就像是瞎子領導瞎子
你如何在你下決心要做之前
知道這是正確的？
大家其實都不想做出承諾
他們害怕承諾

Let’s say you get to the next level when you are actually able to commit. What goes wrong then? It's usually because people are not held accountable to things that they committed to. And if people are not held accountable to the things that they committed to, then they can’t get results. If you think about the company as a black box and results, whether it's financial, whether you produce a great product, or anything like that as the output, one of the major inputs is the culture of the company. Some other best practices, we are actually going to talk though in the Q and A because I think they are going to blend into the conversation, is that you want to incorporate your mission into your values, we talked about that.

所以假設你想進入下一步
那時你能做出承諾了
然後會有什麼問題呢？
通常因為大家都不用為自己的保證
付出食言的代價
如果大家對他們的承諾
不用擔負責任
那他們就不能得出結果
我想提一下
如果你把一個公司想成一個黑箱子
不論結果是財務上的
還是生產一種很棒的產品
或者其他類似的作為輸出
一個主要的投入就是公司的文化
還有一些不錯的實踐
我們會在問答環節提到
因為我覺得它們和之後談的內容很搭
也就是你想將使命融合到價值觀裡

Performance, you need to think a bit harder, deeper, longer about your values than you might initially think you need to. One of the things I think a lot of companies don't actually do is, they interview for technical fit or skill fit, a competency in that realm, but they don’t actually interview for the culture fit, whether someone will actually believe in and follow the mission. I think that is a big, big no no. I think you can have the smartest engineer in the world but if they don't believe the mission they are not going to pour their heart and soul into it. And that's one of the things where if you actually start thinking about culture, from the interview process, to performance reviews, to making sure that’s a daily habit, you get a lot further with making a great culture.

我們提到過績效
你需要將價值觀想得更多更深更久遠
不止是你最初覺得的那樣
我認為有一個很多公司都不做的事情就是
他們面試時關注技術技能
或該領域的勝任能力
但它們不關注應聘者的文化適合性
以及他們是否真的相信和願意跟隨該使命
我認為這是個很大的錯誤
我覺得你可以找到世界上最聰明的工程師
但是如果他們不相信你們的使命
他們就不會全身心投入工作
如果你真的開始思考公司文化
那麼這是一件從面試過程到績效評估
都需要考慮的問題
以保證那成為日常習慣
那樣就離優秀的文化更進一步

One final point made here, culture, just like customer service or fitness, is like motherhood and apple pie. Everybody wants to provide great customer service, every company wants to have great culture. What they fail to do is make it a daily habit. You just can't be fit, if you don't do it as a daily habit. Eventually you get out of shape, then you get fat, and then you say, Oh I have to go on a crash diet to get back into shape. That doesn't quite work, and the same is true with something like culture. So I think we checked all of these off, so we can go into Q and A with Brian.

將它作為日常習慣的最後一點是
文化就像客戶服務或者說
適應性就像母性和蘋果派
所有人都想提供傑出的客戶服務
所有的公司都想要傑出的文化
但他們失敗在於沒有把它塑造成日常習慣
如果你不每天鍛煉
你就沒法變得健康
最後你身材走形
然後長肥肉
然後你說
好吧我必須要突擊節食來減肥
但這並不起效
公司文化也是這樣
我要講的都說完了
現在我們開始和Brian的問答環節

Brian Chesky: Hello everybody. It’s quiet in here, I'll be honest, now I feel a little less on edge. Nothing worse than a room full of people really, really quiet staring at you, but now I feel better.

好的大家好
這太安靜了說實話
現在好些了現在我覺得沒那麼緊張了
沒什麼比一大堆人安靜的盯著你看更讓人緊張的了
不過我現在好多了
好吧我也緊張了5到10分鐘
允許你緊張長一點是的

Alfred Lin: Well I did it for five or ten minutes, you can do it a little longer. So Brian, could you talk about the process by which you came to understand that culture was important to AirBnB and building a company?

Brian 你能說說
通過什麼過程讓你認識到
文化對於Airbnb的打造很重要的？

Brian Chesky: Yeah, so I think one of the things we realized is, to just give you, I won’t tell the full story of how Airbnb came to be. Some of you may know it. So here’s the very short version the story, Airbnb wasn't meant to be the company we were trying to start. I quit my job, I was living in LA. One day I drove to San Francisco, became roommates with my friend from college, from the Rhode Island School of Design, Joe Gebbia, and I had one thousand dollars in the bank and the rent was one thousand one hundred and fifty dollars. So that weekend this international design convention was coming to San Francisco, all the hotels were sold out, so we decided to turn the house into a bed and breakfast for the conference. I didn’t have a bed, Joe had three air beds, we pulled them out of the closet and called it The Air Bed and Breakfast. That's how the company started.

好的我想我們其實認識到的一件事是
那我說一下
我不會講Airbnb整個的故事
有些人可能知道
我講一個非常簡短的版本
Airbnb並不是我們開始就想要做的公司
我辭職之後住在洛杉磯
有一天我開車到舊金山
然後和我原來在羅德島設計學院
的朋友Joe Gebbia成了室友
我銀行卡里還有1000美元\N283\N00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,​​740\N但是房租卻要1150美元\N284\N00:12:26,​​930 --> 00:12:29,520\N那個週末舊金山要舉行國際設計大會
所有的旅店都住滿了
所以我們決定把房子改造成
一個為會議定制的提供早餐的旅館
我沒有床Joe有三張氣墊床
我們把它們從櫃子裡拿出來
然後叫它氣墊床和早餐
這就是公司的起步

I recall the story ten thousand times by the way, some version of that story, and I didn't think I'd ever tell that a second time. I remember growing up, I also went to college, my parents were social workers and never thought about me going to art school. They had worried that maybe I would not get a job after college, which I’m sure most parents worry about. Make sure you promise me you get a job with health insurance, I end up starting Airbnb. I remember her telling me, I guess you never got the job with health insurance.

這件事我可能都講過超過1萬次了
但有些版本
我想我還從沒說過第二遍
我記得原來
我去大學唸書
我的父母都是社工
他們對我去藝術學校感到擔憂
他們很擔心我畢業之後找不到工作
對於此事
我保證很多父母都一樣然後她說
向我保證你會找到一份有醫療保險的工作
結果我開始做AirBnB網站了
那是原來的域名
她記得她告訴我
我想你還是沒找到一份有醫療保險的工作

The reason I say this though is, Airbnb was never meant to be the big idea. It was meant to be the thing to pay the rent so we could think of the big idea. Along the way, by solving our problem it became the big idea. So alongside that, we won’t touch on how we built a product, that's probably another conversation that's being talked about, you have to build a team and a great company. And in the early days, we had three co-founders, Joe, Nate, and myself. I think of one of the reasons we're successful was that I was really lucky. I don't think it was really lucky to pick up the idea Airbnb and I don’t think we were lucky to be successful once we had a team. I think we could have come up with a lot of other ideas and been just as successful. I think I was lucky in that I found two great people that I wanted to start up a business with, people I admired. That almost intimidated me by how smart they were. I think that's what the first thing is, to build a team that is so talented that they kind of, slightly make you uncomfortable to be with them, because you know you are going to have to raise your game to be with them.

我說這個的原因是
AirBnB開始從來沒想過要做得多大
而是想辦法要生存下去
之後再想著能做點什麼大事
慢慢的這不僅解決了我們的問題
還成了一個偉大的創意
關於我們到底是怎麼把產品做出來的
我在這裡就暫時不說了這是另一話題
因為其他人可能都說過
你必須建立一個團隊和一個巨大的公司
在早期
們有三個聯合創始人Joe Nate和我自己
我覺得我們能成功的原因就是
我太幸運了
我不覺得幸運的原因
是在於我們有AirBnB這個創意
我也不覺得我們幸運是因為
我們有一個團隊後就成功了
我覺得我們可以想出其它的創意
然後還是做成功
我覺得我很幸運因為我找到了兩個很棒的
我希望一起創業的我崇拜的朋友
他們的聰明才智簡直嚇到我了
我認為搭建一個優秀團隊
首先要做的事情之一就是
找到這些優秀的甚至讓你緊張的人
因為他們知道你必須要
時刻提高自己來和他們為伍


And then when we were working together in the early days, this is 2008, the first thing is we were like a family. You think about founders like parents and the company like a child. That child will manifest in many ways, behaviors that parents have in the relationship. If the parents are functional but not working together then the child is, frankly, going to be pretty fucked up. You don’t want that. You want your culture to be awesome. And so Joe, Nate, and I were a total family the beginning, we usually worked eighteen hours a day, seven days a week. I remember when we were at Y Combinator, we worked together, we ate food together, or even went to the gym together. We may as well have gotten jumpsuit, we didn’t go that far. It was like we were a mission, a special force.

我們最初一起工作的時候
好像是在2008年
首要的事就是我們像一家人一樣
關於創始人
創始人就像是是家長公司是孩子
孩子會在很多方面展現出
父母在關係中的行為表現
如果家長不正常
他們湊不到一起去
那麼小孩說實話肯定也完蛋了
你不想這樣
你希望你的文化變得傑出\N347\N00:14:36​​,180 --> 00:14:39,810\N於是Joe Nate和我開始時就和一家人一樣
我們一天工作18個小時一周7天
我記得我們在YC的時候
我們一起工作
我們一起吃飯
甚至一起去健身
就差同穿一條褲子​​了但還沒到那程度
就好像我們是在執行一個使命
我覺得就像特種部隊一樣

We had this amazing shared way of doing things with amazing accountability, and that was the DNA of a company. And then we were thinking, at some point you build the product to phase two, which is building the company that builds the product. So a lot of the talk is about how to build a product, how to get product market fit. Once people do that, now you have to build a company. It doesn't matter how great your original product idea is, if you cannot build a great company then your product will not endure. As we thought about this, we realized we wanted to build a company for the long term.

我們就一直用這種什麼都分享
共同承擔的驚人方式來工作\N358\N00:15:0​​0,070 --> 00:15:0​​4,350\N然後我們意識到這就像公司的DNA\N359\N00:15:0​​4,350 --> 00:15:0​​5,390\N然後我們開始考慮\N360\N00:15:0​​5,580 --> 00:15:0​​9,330\N在某個時刻我們開始從搭建一個產品\N361\N00:15:0​​9,330 --> 00:15:11,620\N到了打造一個打造產品的公司的第二個階段
所以我們開始更多的探討要如何搭建一個產品
如何讓它能夠適應市場需求
一旦人們開始做這些事時
你就應該建立公司了
不管你一開始的產品創意有多厲害
如果你不能打造一個偉大的公司
那麼你的產品也不會長久
在我們想這個的時候我們認識到一件事
我們希望要打造一個長久的公司
我們最不希望做的一件事我是說
這樣想吧
如果你的公司就像你的孩子
父母希望孩子能比自己活得更久
如果你比孩子活得更久就真悲劇了
而且我感覺如果公司
在我們有生之年起起伏伏最終失敗真是個悲劇
我們不希望那樣
我們希望一個能長期生存的公司

We wanted a company that would endure. To do that, we started noticing companies have something in common. Companies around for a really long time had a clear mission. A clear sense of values, and they had a shared way of doing something that was unique to them and was really special. And so Joe, Nate, and I, when we were three people, decided to look around at companies. I noticed Apple, Steve Jobs’ core value was that he believed people with passion could change the world. He said our products change but our value never has. We learned about Amazon, we learned about Nike, we learned about companies in the early days. You can even use this to talk about nations. Even a nation has core values and a declaration so that the nation may endure longer. We started to realize that we needed to have intention, culture needs to be designed. And that is how we got connected. Because we were funded by Sequoia, Alfred just joined them with Zappos, and I was told Zappos had an amazing culture. We went to Las Vegas and met up with Tony and we learned about it.

為了能那樣
我們也開始注意到公司的一些共同點\N382\N00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53​​,410\N那些能生存很久的公司都有一個\N383\N00:15:53​​,410 --> 00:15:54,750\N清晰的使命
一個很清晰的價值觀
他們都有共同的做事方式
那就是對他們來說非常獨一無二的方式
所以Joe Nate和我當我們還是三個人的時候
決定看看其他公司是怎麼做的
我注意到了蘋果
你們知道喬布斯的核心價值就是
他相信那些有激情的人可以改變世界
他說他們的產品可能會變
但他們的價值觀不會
我們還看了亞馬遜耐克
我們認真學了這些公司早期的情況
這甚至可以運用到國家上
你知道的就算一個國家
也有很強的價值觀和宣言
讓它更長久的存在下去
我們開始意識到我們需要一個目的
需要設計我們的文化
這也是聯繫我們之間的紐帶
因為你們知道我們拿到了紅杉的投資
Alfred剛剛加入了Zappos
別人告訴我Zappos有很不錯的文化
於是我們去拉斯維加斯
和Tony會面然後向他學習

Alfred Lin: So what did you learn?

那你們學到了什麼？

Brian Chesky: Well, you guys are crazy. The thing we learned, and we were three people, was if culture is a way of doing things, there really are two arts. One is behaviors and those can change maybe fifty years from now. There will be rituals and behaviors that change, be different. But there have to be some things that never change. Some principles, some ideas that endure, that make you, you. And I think of core values, integrity, honesty, those aren’t core values. Those are values that everyone should have. But there have to be like three, five, six things that are unique to you. And you can probably think about this in your life. What is different about you, that every single other person, if you could only tell them three or four things, you would want them to know about you. And we realized that when Zappos was one hundred employees, they wrote down these ten core values. The thing I learned from Tony is I wish I didn’t wait until I was one hundred employees to write down a core value. I was talking to Sam, he thinks we are the only company to write our core values down before we hired anyone.

我們三個人學到的就是
文化就是一種做事情的行為方式
它包括兩個部分
一是行為
可能50年之後會大不一樣
會有類似儀式行為上的變化會不同
但是也有一部分是從來不會改變的
有些準則思想會一直存在
成為你的一部分
當我想到核心價值觀時
忠誠誠實並不在列
這只是大家都應該有的
它們是完整的價值觀
但是肯定有
那麼三五個你很特別的地方
你可以自己仔細想想在你生命中
你在什麼地方
和別人都是不同的
如果你只能告訴別人你的三四件事情
你會希望他們知道哪些
然後我們意識到當Zappos有100個員工的時候
他們寫下了9條核心價值觀
是10條
10條核心價值觀
我從Tony那學到的唯一一件事是
我不應該等到
我有100個員工的時候再寫下核心價值觀
我和Sam交談的時候
他說我們是唯一個
還沒開始招聘就寫下核心價值觀的公司

Alfred Lin: How long did it take you to hire your first employee?

你花了多少時間才找到第一個員工？


Brian Chesky: So the first employee was our first engineer, I think we looked for him for four or five months. I probably looked through thousands of people and interviewed hundreds of people.

我們的1號員工是我們第一個工程師
我想我們花了4-5個月來找他
我大概採訪過
我可能看過幾千人的簡歷
然後面試過幾百人
Alfred Lin: By then, when you hired him, when did you write it? Was it on day one or two or was it three?
然後你什麼時候僱傭他的? 什麼時候寫的網站?
你是招到人後第一天就
還是三個月後

Brian Chesky: I think we started working on it around the time of Y Combinator, which would've been January 2009. It was probably a process that evolved over the course of six to seven months. We finished Y Combinator in April 2009, hired our first engineer in July something like that. Probably six months. Some people ask why did you spend so much time on hiring your first engineer. I think bringing in your first engineer is like bringing in a DNA chip to the company. This person, if we're successful, there were going to be a thousand people just like him or her in that company, it still wasn't a matter of getting somebody to build the next three features we need the ship for users. There was something much more long-term and much more enduring which was, do I want to work with one hundred thousand more people like this? Now, you want diversity to play, you want diversity of background, age. You don't want diversity of values, you want very homogenous beliefs. That’s the one thing that shouldn’t be diverse.

我想我是在進來YC之後就在想這個事情
那時候是2009年1月
那個過程可能
花了6-7個月的時間演化
我們在2009年4月從YC結束
然後在7月找到了我們第一個工程師
可能是在第六個月的時候
有些人問我們
為什麼花了這麼多時間在第一個工程師的招聘上
我們的想法是
我感覺你的第一個工程師
就像是給你公司帶入了DNA
這個人會比方說
如果我們成功的話
之後會有千千萬萬的人
像他一樣的人進入公司
所以這不僅僅是
要找人幫我們開發出三個功能
我們得打造一艘供用戶使用得船
有些東西存在的影響很長久
關乎到我是否願意
和一百個或一千個這樣的人共事
現在大家喜歡強調多樣性
你不希望有信念多樣性
希望大家有不同的背景年齡
但你不希望有多樣的價值觀
你要的是非常非常一致的信念
這是一個不能多樣的地方


Alfred Lin: So what were these values?

那你們的價值觀到底是什麼

Brian Chesky: Six core values, I’ll talk about maybe three of them. So the first core value we talk about is champion in mission. And what it really means is that we want to hire people that are here for a mission. We don’t want people here because they think we have a great valuation, they like our office design, they need a job, or they think it’s hot. We want people to be here for the one thing that will never change, and that’s our mission. And just to tell you a quick story about our mission, Airbnb, a lot of people describe it as a way to book a room or book a house and travel around the world. And that’s what we do, but that is not why we do it. To answer the question on what our mission is, is to tell you a story I think it describes it.

我們有6條核心價值觀
我會說說其中的三條
第一條就是為擁護使命
這其實是說
我們希望招聘那些為使命而聚在這裡的人
我們不喜歡那些
因為他們覺得我們的估值高
喜歡我們的辦公室設計
需要個工作或覺得這份工作很熱門的人
我們希望大家聚集在這裡
只為了一個不變的目的
那就是我們的使命
給你們說一個關於我們使命的一個小故事
你知道嗎AirBnB
很多人把它當作一個預定房間
環遊世界的工具
這確實是我們在做的事情
但這不是我們做它的全部原因
為了回答我們的使命是什麼這類問題
我跟你們講個小故事來說明

In 2012, I met a host named Sebastian, we do these new jobs around the world where we do meet ups. Sebastian is probably late fifties in north London. Sebastian looks at me and says, "Brian there is this word you never use on your website." And I say, "What's that word?" And he says, "That word is friendship. I would love to read a story about friendship." I said, "Okay read me a story about friendship." He says, "Six months ago the brunt of riots broke out in front of my home and I was very scared. The next day my mom called me to make sure I was ok, I said yeah mom I’m ok. And she goes, what about the house?" He says, "The house is OK as well." He said, "Here's the interesting thing, from the time the riots broke out to the time my mom called me was a twenty four hour window of time. In the periods between that time, seven of my previous Airbnb guests called me just to make sure I was okay." He said, "Think about that, seven of my own guests called me before my own mother did."

在2012年我遇到一個房主叫Sebastian
我們在世界各地會和房主
聚會交談
我遇見這個叫Sebastian的房主
他可能快60歲了住在倫敦北部
Sebastian看著我說"Brian
你的網站上有個詞從來沒有被提到"
然後我說什麼詞
然後他說就是友誼這個詞
我想告訴你一個關於友誼的故事
我說那好說給我聽吧
他說六個月前
我家被暴亂衝擊了
當時我很害怕
第二天我母親給我打電話問我是否安好
他說是的媽媽我很好
然後她說那房子怎麼樣了
他說恩房子也很好
他說有件有趣的事兒
在我房子被襲擊
和我母親給我打電話之間
剛好是24小時
在那段期間裡
我以往的七個AirBnB住戶
給我打電話向我確認安好
他說你想想
在我媽給我打電話之前有七個客戶先問候我了

I think that says more about his mother than his guests. But in this summer on a typical night or a peak night, we wouldhave four hundred twenty five thousand people staying in homes and living together and they were coming from a hundred and ninety different countries in the world which is every country except North Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba. So just hearing that story, at our core that is what we are about. That’s much more than just booking a room or traveling. That what we are about is we want to help bring the world together. We want to do that by giving a sense of belonging anywhere you go. Our mission is to belong anywhere. So five years from now, twenty years from now, maybe we're still selling rooms and homes to meet in or not, but I can guarantee you we're always going be about a sense of belonging and bringing people together. And that's the more enduring idea.

我不知道這能說明我們的客人質量問題
還是他母親的問題
但在今年夏天
一個普通的夜晚最多
我們會有42.5萬人
和主人一起住在別人家裡
他們來自世界上190個國家
除了朝鮮伊朗敘利亞和古巴幾乎是所有國家
聽到這個故事之後
我覺得這就是我們的核心
我們提供的不僅僅是預定一個房間或者旅行
我們要做的是把世界聯繫在一起
我們想做到
讓你能不管走到哪裡都有回家的感覺
所以我們的使命就是隨遇而安
所以5年20年之後
我們可能還是在賣住宿和房子但也許不是
但是我能保證我們一直會是
在幫人找到歸屬感和將大家聚到一起
這也是一個長久可持續的想法

So when we hire people, the first thing to make sure it is that, if that is your mission, you need to champion your mission. You champion the mission by living the mission. Do you believe in it? Do you have stories about it? Do you use the product? Do you believe in the product? I used to ask crazy questions, one of the crazy questions Sam reminds me of, I use to interview people. So I interviewed the first three hundred employees at Airbnb which people think I’m really neurotic and they may also be true. I used to ask them a question, if you had a year left to live would you take this job? I amended it, people who say yes probably don't like their families. So I changed it to ten years. I feel like you should use whatever time you have left to live. Whatever you want to do in those last ten years you should just do. I really want you to think about that, that was enough time for you to do something you really cared about and the answer doesn't have to be this company. I say fine if what you’re meant to do is travel or start a company just do that, don't come here. Go do that.

So there is this old parable about two men laying bricks. Somebody comes up to the first man and says what are you doing? I’m building a wall. He asks the other guy, he says I’m building a Cathedral. There's a job and there is a calling. We want to hire people not only looking for jobs, but a calling. And that's the first value, champion the mission.

所以當我們招聘的時候
我們第一件事就是要保證
如果這是你的使命那麼你要擁護你的使命
你要用生命來擁護使命
你是否相信它
你有沒有關於它的故事
你用過這個產品嗎
你會為它犧牲自己嗎
我原來總是會問一些奇怪的問題
Sam提醒我有一個瘋狂的問題
我會拿去面試別人
我們公司前300個員工都是我面試的
對此有人覺得我真是神經質
也許是真的吧
但是我過去常問他們一個問題現在已經修改了
我會問他們如果你還有1年可以活
你還會選擇這份工作嗎？
實際上如果有人說是的
你最好別要他因為
那說明他可能不太在乎他的家庭
所以我把時間放寬到10年
因為我覺得
如果你知道自己只有十年的時日了
不論你想在那最後十年做什麼
你都應該去做\N571\N00:22:26,​​420 --> 00:22:28,320\N我很希望人們想想這個問題
10年的時間
足夠你用來完成你想要做的事情了
答案不一定是要加入我們
我覺得如果你的夢想是旅行
或者自己創業都行
你就去做吧別來這裡
去圓你的夢
這裡有一個古老的寓言故事
你們很多人應該聽說過關於兩個人壘磚的
有人跑到第一個人面前
問他在幹什麼
他說我在砌牆
他問另外一個人在幹什麼
他說我在建一座教堂
一個人是在工作
另一個人是在完成使命

I don’t want to take all the time, I will talk about just one more. The second value relates to being frugal and I will tell you a story. By the way, all the founding stories of your company end up becoming the things that you keep talking about to thousands of people, kind of like a child, that these things keep coming back later in life. So Airbnb, I think Marc Andreessen said in the last talk that it was the worst idea that ever worked. I remember people thinking we were crazy, I remember telling people about the idea, I actually told Paul Graham, I said we have this idea it’s called Airbnb. He asked, people are actually doing this? I said, yeah. Question was, what's wrong with them? So I knew the interview wasn't going well and in the interview Paul Graham I think wasn't going to accept us. And we told the story of how we funded the company and here's how it goes. We're introduced, Michael Seibel, who is a partner of Y Combinator, introduced me and Joe to like fifteen investors in the Valley, including some of the ones that have been here and all of them said no to the company. They could have bought ten percent of the company for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. They all said no, they thought it was crazy. No one would ever stay in someone's home.

我們希望僱傭的不是找工作的
而是找使命的人
這是首要的價值觀
為使命而奮鬥
我不希望佔用所有的時間
我再說一個
這樣就不用光是談論價值觀了
第二個價值觀是創意和儉樸
我給你們講個故事
我們的公司
順便說一句所有公司開創時候的故事
都會成為日後人們重複和談論的事情
當到達1000人規模時
會被具體化對吧
有點像你的童年
這些事情之後在生活中還會出現
公司也是一樣
所以在Airbnb 我覺得Marc Andreessen最近一次才說過
這是個最糟糕的成功的想法
它真的是個最糟糕的主意我是說
大家都以為我們瘋了
我記得我和別人說我們創意的時候
我和Paul Graham說過
在我們找他投資的面試中
我說我們有個叫AirBnB的想法
他問居然有人在做這種事
我說是的
他接下來的反應是他們是不是腦子有毛病?
所以我知道我的面試進行的並不好
面試最後我覺得Paul Graham
不會接受我們
然後我們把我們怎樣給公司融資的故事講給他聽
我們是這麼說的
我們被Michael Seibe​​l引薦
我想他是YC的合夥人
把我和Joe介紹給了大概15個矽谷的投資人
包括有些現在在座的
他們全部說不投
他們當時可以花15萬美元
就買到公司10%的股份但他們全部拒絕了
他們覺得這太瘋狂了
沒有人會想住到其他人家裡去

So we ended up funding the company with credit cards and you know those binders kids in school put baseball cards in? We had to put them in those, we had to put them somewhere. That’s how many credit cards we had and we were completely in debt. And in the fall of 2008, we provided housing for the Democratic and Republican National Convention. We had this crazy idea because we weren't selling a lot of homes. In the year after we launched, we had a hundred people a day visiting our website and two bookings, which is generally bad. It’s like releasing a song and a year later three people are listing to it a day. It’s probably not going to be a very popular song. But I believed in it. Joe and Nate believed in it.
所以我們最後用信用卡啟動了這家公司
你們知道那種活頁夾嗎
小孩放棒球卡的那種
我們把信用卡都放進去了
因為我們總得找地方放啊
我們就有那麼多的信用卡

So we are completely in debt, right, and we get this idea. We are an air bed and breakfast providing housing for the Democratic Republican National Convention. What if we made a breakfast cereal for like the Democratic National Convention? And we came up with this Obama themed cereal. And we called it Obama-O’s, the breakfast of change. Then we came up with a Republican themed cereal for John McCain. We found out he was a Captain in the navy. So we came up with… Captain-McCain’s, a maverick in every bite. We had zero dollars and without any money, we tried calling General Mills they told us to stop calling them or they would get a restraining order so that didn't work. We found a local, though an alumni of RISD, who made a thousand boxes deal for us. We ended up sending them to press and eventually within a week it got on national television, national news. We made forty thousand dollars selling breakfast cereal.

在2008年秋天的時候我們為
兩黨國家會議提供了住宿
我們想到了這個瘋狂的創意
因為我們的房子賣的不好
所以基本上當AirBnB發佈時
發布一年以後
我想每天大約有100人來看我們的網站
然後好像就兩個訂單
真是很糟糕
就像發布一首歌
然後一年後每天只有三個人在聽
這首歌恐怕不太受歡迎
但是我對它有信心Joe 和Nate對它也有信心
所以我們負債累累
不知道該怎麼辦
然後我們就想到
我們為兩黨國家會議
提供住宿和早餐
如果我們給民主黨定制一款
早餐麥片會怎麼樣？
然後我們做出了一款以奧巴馬為主題的麥片
我們把它叫做奧巴馬家帶來改變的早餐
然後我們又想出
為John McCain共和黨主題的麥片
我們了解到他原來當過海軍艦長
於是我們想出
McCain船長家滿口傲骨
我們一毛錢也沒有
試著聯繫通用穀物公司
他們告訴我們不要再打電話了
不然他們就會找法院要製止令所以沒成功
通過羅德島設計學院我們找到一個當地的供應商
給我們做了1000盒
我們發給電視台
最終在一個星期內
就得到了在全國新聞的播出
我們賣早餐麥片得到了四萬美元

In 2008 we made five thousand dollars from our website and we made forty thousand dollars selling breakfast cereal. I remember my mom asking so are a you cereal company now. And that wasn't that bad part, the bad part was the honest answer which was technically, yes. But the reason I tell that is our second core value is to be a cereal entrepreneur. I'm sorry for the cheesy pun. But be a cereal entrepreneur. We really mean, is that we believe constraints bring out the creativity. When you raise eight hundred million dollars suddenly all that scrappiness, it's easy to lose that scrappiness. It’s easier for people to tell you I just need this fifty thousand dollar contract. I need this, I need that. When people are desperate and not being a little bit frugal, not being creative, or tell me they can't do something, I'll just take a box of cereal and even the suggestion of Obama-O’s is you need to be scrappy and frugal. So again a lot of the founding DNA of your company becomes these values, these principles. Everyone knows that if you don't give a crap you shouldn't be here. And it doesn't mean you have to give a crap it just means you have to to be here. You also have to be creative to be an entrepreneur and super scrappy. And these are some of the values we learned.

2008年我們從我們的網站賺了五千美元
而從賣麥片賺到了四萬美元
我記得我媽媽問那你們現在是麥片公司嗎？
這不是糟糕的部分
糟糕的是我的誠實的回答技術上說是的
但是我說這些是因為我們的第二個核心價值觀
就是做早餐的企業
不好意思我的雙關語有點矬
但想成為穀物企業家我們真正的意思是
我們相信約束會帶來的創造力
當你籌集八億美元
突然間所有的鬥志
就很容易消失
別人很容易告訴你
我只需要這五萬美元的合同
我需要這個我需要那個
無論什麼時候某人不那麼儉樸
不那麼有創造力時
或者告訴我他們做不到
我就把一盒麥片
甚至Obama-O的建議
他們需要儉樸有鬥志
所以很多你們公司的創始DNA
成為公司價值觀原則
於是每個人都知道如果你不關心的話
就別留在這
這不是說你必須關心它
只是說你必須在這裡
你必須有創意
才能成為一個有鬥志的企業家
這些是我們得到的一些經驗教訓

Alfred Lin: So you guys should start to think about questions when we open up to questions from the audience but I have a few more questions to ask. So this all sounds nice, stories are great. The people here are a pretty skeptical group. It’s a CS department class, probably left brain focused. This feels like a softie, right brain focus. How does having a strong culture help you make important, tough decisions?

很好
當我們開始觀眾問答環節的時候
你們可以準備好問題
但我有幾個問題想要先問
這一切聽起來不錯故事很棒
這裡的人都很有懷疑精神
這是計算機科學系的課
可能左腦集中
這感覺就像一個柔弱的右腦集中
我很弱的不好意思
擁有一個強大的企業文化
如何幫助你做重要的艱難的決定?

Brian Chesky: Well I think that having it so, here's the thing about culture. There are three things they never tell you about culture. First thing is they never tell you anything about culture. No one talks about culture and no one ever tells the need to have strong culture. So there's tons of articles about building a great product, there's tons of articles on growth and adaption, and a few things about culture. It’s a mystical thing that's soft and fuzzy. That's the first problem. The second problem is it is hard to measure. Things that are hard to measure often get discounted. These are two very hard things. The third thing, the biggest problem, it doesn't pay off in the short term. If you wanted to start up a company and sell it in one year, the one thing I would tell you to do is fuck up the culture. Just hire people quickly. Culture makes you hire really slowly, makes you deliberate about your decisions that in the near term can slow progress. Putting an investment into the company short term.

我認為擁有這樣的文化
有這樣的含義
有三件關於文化的事實大家從不告訴你
第一件是他們從來不告訴你任何關於文化的事情
沒有人談文化
從來沒有人說你需要強大的企業文化
有一大堆文章教你如何做好產品
有一大堆關於如何增長和適應的文章
而關於文化的事情很少
它是個軟而模糊的神秘的事
這是第一個問題
第二個問題是很難衡量
很難衡量的措施經常被忽略
這是兩個非常困難的事情
第三件事也是最大的問題
關於文化的最大問題是
它不會在短期內有回報
事實上如果你一年內
想啟動一個公司並儘快出售它
我會告訴你的一件首要事情是去他的文化
別管它盡快招人
文化會讓你招人很慢
讓你的決定變緩
在短期內會進展緩慢
就好像
短期內投資一個公司
這些是人們不會告訴你的
所以文化真的是關於建立一個長期發展的公司
所要考慮的
還有些關於文化的事情

First thing is the need to be very clear about what's unique to you that you stand for. Once you do that, you need to hire people that believe in that. You need to make sure you hire and fire based on these values. One thing we do is constantly repeat over and over again when we interview, we want to make sure they are world class and fit the culture. The first thing I used to ask people at the end of the interview, I would say if you can hire, this is a functional question, if you could hire anybody in the world, would you hire the person sitting across from you? If our vision is the best in the world, why aren’t we hiring the best in the world? Every single person is meant to hire a person better than the previous people. You are constantly raising the bar. Then we have separate people called core values interviewers who aren’t in the function. So it you are an engineer, the core values interviewers are never engineers because we don't want them to be biased and say well I know how good they are. And they interview just for values, to make sure that people care about the same thing. And we said no to a lot of really great people because we just didn't feel right about them being with us long term. So that's one of the things.


第一件事是你需要非常清楚
能獨特的代表你的是什麼
一旦你知道了
你需要雇傭相信這一點的人
所以我們面試了幾百人
你需要確保你在這些價值觀
的基礎上招人炒人
當我們面試時我們常常
一遍遍地做的事情是
我們要確保他們是世界一流的符合我們的文化
所以我常常問他們的第一件事是
這個問題在面試表格最後會有
問題就是
這是個開放式問題
如果你能可以僱傭世界上任何人
你會僱傭坐在你對面的人嗎?
如果我們的願景是做世界上最好的
我們為什麼不聘請世界上最好的呢
每個人都應該僱傭
比自己更好的人
你要不斷提高標準
你要一直招聘世界頂級的人
然後我們還有其他人
稱為核心價值觀面試官
不是一個部門的
所以如果你是個工程師
核心價值觀面試官從來都不是工程師
因為我們不希望他們是有偏見的
說什麼我知道他們很棒之類的話
他們面試的只是價值觀
以確保人們關心同樣的事情
我們拒絕過很多真正不錯的人
因為我們感覺不對
覺得他們不會待長久
這是一件事


Some other examples of when we have had to make hard decisions: in mid-2011, we were mostly United States and we had this internet clone funded by these guys called the Samwer brothers, anyone ever hear of them? They basically clone internet companies. They recently went public. They take American websites and clone them and then quickly try to sell them back to you. It’s kind of like putting a gun to your head. So they had done this to Groupon, Groupon was the fastest growing site in the world ever. They stopped doing Groupon and started cloning us, and this is back when we had forty employees, we had raised seven million dollars. They cloned us and in thirty days they hired four hundred people. And they wanted to sell the company and if they couldn’t, they were going to destroy us around the world.

還有一些其他的例子
當我們做出艱難的決定時
2011年年中
我們主要是在美國
然後有一個Samwer兄弟
投資的網絡克隆
有人聽說過他們嗎?
他們基本上就是克隆對火箭網
他們剛上市
他們把美國網站克隆然後很快
試圖回售給被克隆的網站
如果你不買他們就
這就像把槍指著你的頭
他們對高朋團購做過這事兒
高朋團購當時是世界上發展最快的
公司
在收入上達到十億美元規模
然後他們呢就沒做高朋網了
那時高朋團購是世界第一了
然後他們就克隆我們
這時我們有四十個員工
我們籌集了七百萬美元
他們克隆我們籌到了九千萬
三十天內招到四百人
然後他們想把公司賣給我們如果我們不買
他們就要在全世界範圍內摧毀我們

The problem with Airbnb is if we are not everywhere around the world, a travel site not being in Europe is like your phone not having email, it doesn't actually work. So we were kind of in trouble. We had this conversation, it was a pragmatic decision of should we acquire them and then there was the values decision. The pragmatic one probably said buy them because you can't risk losing international, so just guarantee you are going to get international. We ended up not buying them. The reason we ended up not buying them was I just didn't like the culture. I didn’t want to bring in those four hundred people. I felt like we were missionaries and they were mercenaries. I didn't feel like they were doing it for the beliefs, I thought they were doing it to make a lot of money very quickly.

AirBnB的問題是
如果我們不是都在世界各地
就像一個旅遊網站如果沒有歐洲業務
就像你的手機沒有電子郵件
就沒有用所以我們陷入困境
我們討論過這是個務實的決定
我們應不應該收購他們然後還有價值觀的抉擇
務實的決定可能會說買他們
因為你不能冒險失去國際市場
所以一定要保證你能國際化
但我們最終沒有購買
我們最終不買的原因是
我不喜歡他們的文化
我不想把這四百人帶到公司來
我覺得我們是傳教士他們是僱傭軍
我不覺得他們是為了信仰而戰
我認為他們這樣做是為了很快賺到很多錢

I believed in a war, missionaries would outlast and endure mercenaries. I also felt like the best revenge against an internet clone was just to make them run the company long term. You had the baby, now you've got to raise it. So that's what we ended up doing and that was a very controversial decision. A lot of people were telling me you should buy this company, we didn't and I think it worked out

我相信戰爭中
傳教士會戰勝僱傭兵比他們更加持久
我也覺得最好的報復一個互聯網克隆的辦法
就是讓他們長期經營公司
你生了孩子那你就得養大它
這就是我們最終做的
這是一個非常有爭議的決定
很多人告訴我你應該買本公司
我們沒有但我覺得成功了

Alfred Lin: What percentage of revenue comes from Europe?

你們多少百分比的收入來自歐洲

Brian Chesky: More than fifty percent

超過50%

Alfred Lin: I think it worked out. Okay, anybody have any questions? I can keep going . No one? One statement we had at Zappos is culture and brand were two sides of the same coin. Airbnb has a great culture and a great brand. Do you care to talk about branding, it’s kind of a weak thing, it's a value we don't tend to focus on.

我想它成功了是的
好吧有人有什麼問題嗎?
我可以繼續
再提個問題
我們在Zappos
常說文化和品牌是一個硬幣的兩面
AirBnB有一個偉大的文化和一個偉大的品牌
你願意談談品牌嗎
因為這是一種軟性的東西
在矽谷我們通常不會關注文化和品牌

Brian Chesky: I actually just said that to Sam. I think Silicon Valley is not historically really strong or we don't talk about culture and brand very much. They are two sides of the same coin. So culture, like the principles and the beliefs you have inside a company that you want people to be aligned with long term, whatever happens inside the company eventually comes out, you can’t hold it in. And brand is really the promise outside the company that everyone identifies with. So I think having a clear mission and making sure that you know that mission and the mission comes through the company, is probably the best thing you can do for both culture and values.

我其實才和Sam討論過
我認為矽谷在歷史上不是非常強的
或我們不談論文化和品牌
它們是一枚硬幣的兩面
所以文化就像原則和信仰
是在公司裡的
你希望人們能長久地聚在一起
無論在公司內部發生什麼
最終會暴露
你無法掩藏
品牌是公司對外的承諾
每個人都認同
所以我認為有一個明確的使命
並確保你知道
那個使命以及公司如何發展出這個使命
這可能是你能為文化和價值觀做的
最重要的事

And then the second thing you know is that your brand, the way people think about you and your company, is often decided by your brand evangelists who are your employees. If you have a weak culture, we often think that companies that hire employees, people that are deeply passionate, create companies that customers are really passion about. Those are companies with strong brands. And so Zappos had a really strong brand. A lot of companies, Google, that cared deeply about culture, they actually have a question, is this person Google? Which is meant to be like the catch all for the digital culture. It was a very strong culture, Google has a unique, there's no such thing as a good or bad culture, it’s either a strong or weak culture. And a good culture for someone else may not be a good culture for you.


So I think brand is incredibly important as well. Brand is really the connection of you with your customers and so if you have an incredibly strong culture, the brand will come through. The final thing to say about brand is a lot of people that talk about their brand talk about what they sell. So if you’re Apple, one way of doing the same, we sell computers and the new screens are larger and faster and they talk about bits and bytes.

然後第二件事是你的品牌
人們思考你和你的公司的方式
通常是由你的品牌佈道者也就是你的員工決定
如果你有一個弱勢文化
我們經常認為僱傭人的公司
非常有激情的員工
建一個能讓客戶充滿熱情的公司
這些都是擁有強大品牌的公司
所以Zappos有一個非常強大的品牌
因為他們又很強大的文化
很多公司比如穀歌
深入關心公司文化
他們實際上有一個問題這是谷歌人嗎
這像是個
他們是否適合谷歌文化的容器
谷歌是個非常強的文化很獨特
順便說一下沒有所謂的好與壞的文化
只有強弱之分
對別人是好文化
對你未必是好的
所以我認為品牌也相當重要
品牌實際上連接著你和你的客戶
所以如果你有一個超強大的企業文化
品牌也會興盛
但如果你有一個一般強的文化
那品牌也會獲得成功
關於品牌我最後想說
很多人談論他們的品牌
談論他們賣的產品
所以如果你是蘋果公司一種方式是說
我們賣的電腦屏幕更大速度更快
他們談論比特和字節

I remember Steve Jobs had this really important talk where he says the way to win, this is 1997, isn't to talk about bits and bytes. The way to win is talk about what we value, what our core values are, we believe passionate people can change the world. And that was how they introduced a different campaign. So Apple, before they had this huge renaissance, became the most valuable company in the world. They did the Think Different campaign, which is basically saying this is what we believe in. That if you buy an Apple computer, you're also saying I believe in this too. And there has to be a deeper core belief, and if that doesn’t happen, you’re a utility. And utilities get sold at commodity prices.

我記得喬布斯有過這樣重要的談話
他說成功的方法
是在1997年他首次回歸蘋果時
他沒有談論比特和字節
成功的方法關乎我們的價值
在於我們的核心價值是什麼
我們相信充滿激情的人可以改變世界
所以我們推崇“不同凡想”運動
所以蘋果在這個巨大的複興之前
成為了世界上最有價值的公司
他們發起了"不同凡想"的活動
基本上說的也就是我們信念
如果你買一個蘋果電腦
你也是在說我相信它
當然這必須有一個更深層次的核心信念
如果不是這樣你就只是個用品
用品只能被賣到商品價格
你如何溝通這個想法
問題是你怎麼知道
如何傳達本公司的
文化或核心價值
不管是對員工還是對外部世界
文化價值觀還是品牌


Alfred Lin: The question is how do you know how to communicate this company culture or core value to the outside world?

問題就是
在早期如何溝通Airbnb做的事情？

Brian Chesky: So the question is, how do you communicate what Airbnb does in the earlier days. Well we learned a lot because in the early days we communicated like a utility. We actually said Airbnb is a cheap, affordable alternative to hotels. Our tag line was forget hotels, save money with Airbnb. And over time we felt like that was, this was way back in the day, we felt like that was way too limiting, that it undercut the idea. We changed our tag line to travel like a human. Which we haven’t kept, but it was basically meant to say that we believe in a certain kind of world and we really feel like travel is mass produced. You feel isolated, you feel like a stranger, and we want to bring the world back to the place where it feels like a village again, where the service is coming from other people, where you have this feeling you belong, and you are treated like a human.

我們學到了很多
因為早期我們溝通的是像一個實用品
實際上我們說Airbnb是便宜的
負擔得起的酒店替代品\N924\N00:35:55​​,250 --> 00:35:57,560\N我們的口號就是忘記酒店
用Airbnb省錢
隨著時間的推移我們覺得
這是在退步
我們覺得太限制
削弱了我們的創意
因此我們改變了我們的口號
像人類一樣旅行
我們沒有保存
但這基本上是說
我們相信在特定的世界中
旅行是大規模生產的
你感到孤立
你覺得像一個陌生人
我們想讓世界回到
像一個村莊的時候
那裡的服務是來村里的其他人
你有歸屬感
被真正像人對待

No matter how successful you are in life, often traveling will remind you that you are not that successful. Go through TSA, stay in a typical hotel, sometimes you'll have some problems. We really wanted to make people feel special. This is some of the stuff we did in the early days, we did a lot of storytelling. I mean I've probably told the story of Airbnb ten thousand times and this is a something that is kind of related to culture. Someone asked me the other day, what’s the job of the CEO? There are lots of things a CEO does, but what you mostly do is articulate the vision. To articulate a vision you have to develop a strategy and hire people that fit the culture. If you do those three things you basically have a company and that company will hopefully be successful.

無論生活中你如何成功
旅行總會提醒你
你並不是那麼的成功
通過TSA
住傳統酒店
有時你會遇到問題
我們真的想讓顧客感受到與眾不同
這就是早期我們一部分員工做的
這裡有很多故事可講
我指的是
我把Airbinb的故事講了上萬次
這也和一個企業的文化相關
某天有人問我
CEO的工作是什麼
CEO有很多的事情要做
但最應該做的就是說清你的願景
為了說清願景
就要製定一個好的戰略
你就要雇傭適合公司文化的人
如果你做了這三件事情
就基本有一個公司樣了
那這家公司就有希望成功

If you have the right vision, a good strategy, and the people to get there. And so what you end up doing is articulating the vision over and over. Whether it’s recruiting, talking to investors, getting funding, doing PR interviews, speaking in a class room. You are always reinforcing the values. You’re doing it in an email to a customer. You just do it a thousand times, it changes and gets better and better every time. So it kind of evolved.

如果你有好的願景正確的戰略和優秀的合夥人
那我們最後要做的就是
不斷的闡明我們的願景
不管是在招聘還是融資
還是在做公關採訪
或者給人家上課
你總是在強調你的公司價值
你給客戶發電子郵件強調公司價值
你只需重複上萬遍
而如果你一件事做了上萬遍
情況會變的越來越好就像是一種進化

Very good question. How do we make sure the hosts are reinforcing the culture of Airbnb? So the answer to that is we do a pretty good job, but not yet an amazing job at that. When we first founded Airbnb, I took the Craig Newmark school of thought, Craig is the founder of Craigslist: anyone should be able to use Airbnb. If you want to rent your place, you should be able to. It turns out, many people believe in our values because we talked about them and believed them. But there were people who rented on Airbnb, not because they believed in the values but instead because they realized they could make a lot of money renting their home. And not everyone was a great culture fit. These people actually did cause us a lot of problems, so this was a lesson for me. I didn't think, it didn’t occur to me in the early days that the hosts had to completely fit our values. We met them, we attract people like us. We realized hosts are like partners and they need to believe in the same culture we do. So now we have this program called the Super Host program where they have to demonstrate values to reach this kind of badge which gets the priority customer support and distribution. We are having this important host convention where we bring all the hosts in and will be talking about reinforcing our values. So the answer is, we were really late, but we now do it by reinforcing it every step of the way.

你說你在和主人進行互動的時候
用什麼樣的方式管理房主
強化Airbnb的控制
很好的問題
我們怎樣確保房主
強化Airbnb的文化
這個問題的答案是我們做的很好
但還不夠
當我們開始做Airbnb的時候
我採用了Craig Newmark的思想
他是Craigslist的創始人
我講過任何人都應該能使用Airbnb
不需要申請
你想要出租房間你就可以
結果也表明許多人認同我們的理念
因為我們不斷與他們溝通並且追踪他們
但也有些人他們使用Airbnb
不是因為相信這些觀念而是
覺得他們可以
通過租出屋子賺到很多錢
並不是每個人都能很好適應一個文化
而那些人也確實給我們帶來了不少的問題
所以這對我來說也是個教訓
早期我也確實沒有想到這些
也就是房主要完全適應我們的文化
我們跟他們見面吸引那些符合我們文化的人
隨著時間推移我們開始意識到房主就像合作夥伴
他們需要相信我們的價值觀
現在我們有個叫做超級房主的項目
項目裡他們得展示自己的價值觀
以贏得獎章和
有助於得到顧客支持和分配
我們簽署有包含所有房主的
房東公約
我們會在裡面強化我們的價值觀
所以我覺得我們確實晚了一步
並會在接下來的每一步都強調它們

Q: Brian, Airbnb has made some great contributions to the open source community. Do you have any thoughts on how that contributes to your culture and company values?

當Airbnb已經開始給開源社區
做出很大貢獻
關於這些是如何給你們的開發團隊
和文化做出貢獻的你有什麼想法？

Brian Chesky: Yeah, I think just in general, it may be related to two things about Airbnb. We tend to be a pretty open culture just in general, we believe in a shared world where people are giving back, contributing to making communities and industries stronger. It’s my philosophy to talk about everything internally, except for things that relate to customer or client privacy, if it doesn’t relate to those two things, then we will talk about it.

我覺得總的來說
它可能與Airbnb的兩個方面有關
一般來說我們更傾向於比較開放的文化
我們交流很多我們通常相信
一個大家喜歡分享貢獻的世界
能夠讓社區和行業變的更加強大
我自己的一個溝通哲學就是
我們會溝通和談到的一切內部事物
除了那些涉及員工
或者客戶隱私的話題
如果不涉及這兩個方面
我們基本上都會拿出來說


As far as open source culture and engineering, we wanted to make sure that we had a really strong identification of the team and so we really felt like a lot of source code shouldn't be you know, we felt like every company needs some kind of moat that protects you from your competition. We thought some technology would be, but we also felt like we wanted to give back from a technology standpoint. We preferred our moat to be that we provide the very best experience in the world when you use Airbnb, that has the biggest network effects. We thought that kind of took precedent over some of the technology that we use, so we decided to try to share some of that out to people. I think it does relate to the values, I never recommended, I never one day recommended we do any of that. We hired engineers that we thought shared our values in culture and they felt that was the right thing to do.

就開源文化和工程而言
我們想要確保
我們的團隊有很強的團隊認同感
我們真的覺得很多源代碼不應該開源
你知道我覺得
每個公司都需要一道護城河
來保護你們免於競爭
我們覺得一些技術可以開源
我們也認為我們希望能從技術的角度得到回報
我們更希望我們的護城河是
當人們使用Airbnb的時候我們能給他們帶來最好的體驗
我們有最大的網絡效應
我們認為我們開創了一個先例
就是只用我們能夠使用的某種技術
並決定把其中一部分分享給其他人
此外這也涉及到價值觀
另一個我之前沒提到過的建議是
如果你有很強的企業文化我不建議
我們做這些事情我們只僱傭那些
我們覺得適合我們價值觀的工程師
他們碰巧也想要這麼做
而且他們覺得這樣做是合適的

Q: You talk about conventions, what did you do when you had no money and you only got paid for those who used your site. What did you do to scale that up? How did you get users to the site.

你有提到在某個階段
你沒有錢
也很少有人瀏覽你的網站
你採取了什麼措施吸引用戶來你們的網站
你是如何擴展了業務的

Brian Chesky: So this is not about culture, but I will answer it anyway. The best advice I ever got was probably from Paul Graham. Paul Graham said, I remember he had this line, it's better to have a hundred people that love you than to have a million people that just sort of like you. It's literally better to have a hundred people love you. And the reason why, if you have one million customers, one million users and they just kind of don't care about you but they use your app and think you're okay, to get them to care is a really hard thing, I don’t know how to get a million people to all of a sudden care. But I do know if you get a hundred people who love you, those people, if they feel incredibly passionate, they will go out and eacb tell a hundred people. All movements that lead to companies or ideas start with just a hundred people.

雖然這和企業文化無關
但是我還是會回答你
你知道很多人
這是個和企業文化無關的問題不過
我從Paul Graham那裡得到的最好的意見
他大致是說
我記得他講的這些話
有一百人愛你遠比
有100萬人只是喜歡你更好
就是說有一百個人愛你更好些
為什麼呢
因為如果你有100萬客戶或者是用戶
他們不那麼關心你
但是卻使用你的App 這樣也行
讓他們關注你是很困難的
其實我也不知道怎麼讓百萬人突然關注我們
但我知道如果你有一百個用戶愛你
如果他們真的熱愛你的產品
他們就會去每人告訴一百個人

So the reason this is so critical, is he gave us another lesson which is that if all you need do is get a hundred people to love you, is do things that don’t scale. So it's hard if you've got a million people, you can't you meet them all. You can meet a hundred people, you can spend time with them. So that's exactly what we did. Joe, Nate, and I would go door to door in New York City, or in Denver where the Democratic National Convention was, literally staying and living with our users. It's a joke that when you buy an iPhone, Steve Jobs does not come sleep on your couch. But I will. That was really critical, living with our users. All we had to do was get in with them and share a passion with our users. You work backwards from a hundred people, even one person. But with our new technology, imagine what would be an amazing experience for just this one person. Walk through the journey from that one person, make it perfect for that one person. Once you make it perfect for one person, it's actually really easy to make a service easy for one person, it’s not that hard. Where everyone gets in trouble is they try to solve both at the same time. So the first thing we did was went door to door, that is one thing, that set up memories.

那麼事實上一切就可以開始了
那些很強大的公司或想法
都是從百人規模開始的
所以關鍵的原因是
他給了我們另一個教訓\N1085\N00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,​​910\N也就是如果你需要\N1086\N00:42:26,​​910 --> 00:42:28,420\N讓100個用戶愛你
那麼你就不要擴大規模
如果你有百萬用戶
見到他們所有人是很難的
但是你可以見100個人
你可以在他們身上花時間
這也是我們之前做的
Joe Nate和我在民主黨全國大會召開的時候
在紐約和丹佛挨門走訪
簡直是和我們的用戶吃住都在一起
我曾開玩笑說當你買了iPhone
喬布斯不會來和你睡沙發上但是我會
所以這非常重要和你的用戶住在一起
通過和他們住在一起花時間陪他們
我們所需做的就是給他們足夠的時間和重視
讓他們達到
深深的熱情的狀態
如果你能退回到與
100人甚至是1人
甚至是在沒有技術的情況下工作
想像一下這對於這個人
是多麼奇妙的經歷
一路走來從用戶開始喜歡
不管你的服務是什麼
要將其完善變得對用戶來說更加完美
一旦你為一個人提供完美的服務體驗
其實那很容易
為一個人提供完美的服務體驗
事實上不是那麼難困難的是
如何將它帶給數以萬計的人
有人一開始就陷入困難
因為他們想同時解決這些問題
因此我們要做的第一件事就是
如何讓一個人得到完美的用戶體驗
我們挨門挨戶做這件事情
贏得了用戶的喜愛
接著我們開始思考
我們如何實現讓更多用戶獲得完美體驗


I will give one more example before I stop talking about this. Right now with Airbnb you can click a button and put in your home and a professional photographer comes to your home and photographs it for free. We have five thousand photographers around the world and we have photographed hundreds of thousands of homes. So it is the probably one of the largest on-demand photography groups around. I believe this started with Joe and I, we were staying with this one host, in New York City and her house is amazing but her photos were terrible. So we asked, why you don’t put up better photos? This is before the life of the great cameras, 2008. She couldn’t figure out how to get photos from her phone onto her computer. She wasn’t a very technically savvy woman. And I just said, we will just take photos for you. Actually, I said, what if you could press a button and somebody would show up at your door to take professional photographs? She said that would be magic.

在我結束這個話題之前
我舉個例子
目前在Airbnb
如果你把你房屋信息放到Airbnb上
你可以點擊一個按鈕一個專業的...
有點兒類似於UBER的運作方式
但我們是在它之前這樣做的有專門的攝影師
跑來你家為你家房屋免費拍照
我們在全球範圍內有5000多個攝影師
我們已經拍攝了成千上萬的房屋照片
這或許是
最大的按需攝影網之一
如果真有這樣的東西
我猜這也有可能是世界上唯一的
剛開始我和Joe
我們曾經在紐約一戶人家待過
她的房子很漂亮但是照片卻看起來很爛
我們問她為什麼不好好把照片拍一下
這是在08年iPhone還沒有很好的攝像頭
她不懂
怎麼把照片從手機裡弄到電腦上
她對於拍照不在行
我們就說我們可以給你拍照
其實我說如果能讓你點下鼠標
就有專業的人上門
來給你照相你覺得怎麼樣？
她說這聽起來不太可能

So the next day, I knock on her door going, I’m here. I photographed her home. I sent a few emails to people saying we give this new magical photography service and if you want, you can press the button for a professional photographer to show up at your home. So they would hit this button and it would send me this alert. We rented a camera in Brooklyn. And in January 2009, walking through the snow, we photographed people’s homes. We did this by hand without any technology. We managed that with spreadsheets. I wasn’t going to bother Nate to design something for photography. Then we started hiring contract photographers. Eventfully we got an intern to manage all the contract photographers. Then we made a full time position to manage the other interns of the contract employees. And at some point, this is before we built anything, at some point there were too many people to manage. There were like hundreds of photographers. Then we built all the tools to do all the photography. But we did it only after we knew what the perfect service was.

第二天我就上門說我來了
給她的房子拍攝了照片
然後我們給客戶發郵件告訴他們
我們開始提供一項免費拍照的新服務
只需要你直接點一下就行
專業攝影師就會上門服務
只要有人點一下
我和Joe就會收到提醒
我們在布魯克林租了相機
2009年一月我們在雪中
幫人們拍攝房屋照片
沒有任何技術都是手工完成的
我們用電子表格完成這些
我沒有去麻煩Nate
來努力將我們的設計打造出來
那是我們拍照之後了
之後我們開始僱傭合同攝影師
我們找到了實習生
管理這些合同攝影師
然後我們找了個實習生變成了正式員工
管理其他管理合同員工的實習生
這是我們開始構建這一切之前的事情
但是在某一時期我們有太多的員工要管理
比如有了幾百個攝影師
於是我們開發了工具
管理這些圖片
但是我們這樣做的前提是
我們搞清楚了什麼是完美的服務

Q: One more question, the question is, in this particular situation with Airbnb, a lot of people think it is not necessarily a technology company, but more of a marketing company.

再提一個問題
很多人說
最厲害的地方不是技術
而是市場營銷是溝通能力
在Airbnb
所以很多人說Airbnb不是個技術公司
而是營銷公司

Brian Chesky: Good question. I will answer the question with a story.
我會用一個故事來回答這個問題

Alfred Lin: Let me preface that question with a series of questions. Do you today have propriety technology?
讓我用一些提問來還原這個問題吧 目前你們有專利技術嗎？有
Brian Chesky: Yes.

Alfred Lin: Do you have a moat?

Brian Chesky: Yes

你們有護城河技術嗎？有
Alfred Lin: Do you have network effects?

Brian Chesky: Yes.
你們能形成網絡效應嗎？有
Alfred Lin: Do you have pricing power?


你們有定價權嗎？有
Brian Chesky: Yes

Alfred Lin: Do you have a good brand?

Brian Chesky: I think so .
你們有好的品牌嗎？我想是的
Alfred Lin: Are you a monopoly?

Brian Chesky: I am not going to answer that one
你們是一個壟斷企業嗎？ 我不會回答這個
Alfred Lin: Getting back to the question, just forgetting about all of that, companies that have network effects and sort of get off the ground, the fly wheel is going, people just think you are lucky.

但是我認為一個類似的問題
換個方式來問
有網絡效應的那些公司
開始起步發展
人們只是覺得你很幸運

Brian Chesky: Let me just answer that one. It’s a totally fair question and people have said it so I want to answer it. The guy who owns Sequoia Capital, his name is Doug Leone. One day, I think it was a year, year and half ago, he says, Your job sucks. And I was all, What the hell does that mean? He says, You have the worst job of any CEO in my portfolio. I said, Tell me why.

這個問題我來回答
是個很公正的問題
人們既然那麼說了我想回答這個問題
現在擁有紅杉資本投資的人叫Doug Leoni
有一天我記得應該是一年半以前
Doug Leoni 說你的工作爛透了
我問這是個什麼意思他說
你是在我投資的CEO里工作最糟糕的
我就問他為什麼

And this is what he said. "First of all you are a technology company," and I would say that at our heart we are a technology company. "So you have all the challenges of all the other portfolio companies. But beyond that, you are in a hundred and ninety different countries. So you have to figure out how to be international. You have to hire in every country in the world." We are literally in every country except North Korea, Iran, Syria, and Cuba. We are a payments company. We handle billions of dollars of transactions a year, we had to get a business license in the state of California. We have serious fraud and risk. It needs to be locked down like Fort Knox. He said, "That’s usually where companies end. But you have to worry about all the other crap. Trust and safety."

他是這樣說的
他說我是這麼覺得的
第一你們是家技術公司
他認為我們是家技術公司我想說
從心裡來說我們確實是
所以你們面臨其它技術公司
面臨的所有挑戰
除此之外你還在190多個國家有業務
也就是你還要解決如何國際化的問題
我們確實不得不在全球範圍內招募員工
基本上是每個國家
當然除了朝鮮伊朗敘利亞
你們還是一家支付型公司
我們的支付系統每年要處理數十億美元的交易
我們必須要獲取加州的
金錢交易執照
作為支付型公司
我們得面臨欺詐和擔保風險
需要像諾克斯堡一樣被護好
他覺得同行公司就會這麼死掉
但你還得擔心其他人的流言
他說你要讓人覺得你是安全的

We have four hundred and twenty five thousand people staying in other people's individual beds, in their sheets. Think about a woman from Texas staying in the Middle East, or vice versa. Think about the cultural conflicts that could happen and misunderstandings. You have four hundred and twenty-five thousand people a night. It’s like being the Mayor of Oakland. So imagine you are the Mayor of Oakland and all the things that happened in Oakland tonight. You have trust and safety.

我們有42.5萬人
住在別人家里人家的床上
想像一下有個德州女士在中東
反之亦然
文化衝突誤會都可能發生
畢竟每晚有42.5萬人之多
這和當奧克蘭的市長一樣
想像下如果你是奧克蘭的市長
這些今晚就會發生在你管轄區域的事情
你應該保證安全

Now we have regulatory problems. We are in thirty thousand different cities. Every city has different rules, different laws, and many were written in a different century. They were written before you had all the technology. Then you have issues like search and discovery. Google has this thing about being really good at search. Google can give me all these results, but it’s clear that there is only one or two right answers for everybody. We have forty thousand homes in Paris. There is no best home in Paris for anyone in this room. So we have to be really, really great at matching people and technology. Another example, Facebook is a digital product. Their product is their website. Our product is these experiences that you have in the real world. We are not just an online product, but also an offline product. So basically the long and the short of it is we have to be world class at technology, world class at design, we have to be world class at branding. We have to convince government we are good for their neighborhood. Because we have to convince people that we are not crazy, this is a real thing, we have to make sure trust and safety is world class. We handle all these payments and handle risk. And I didn’t even mention culture. This was not about culture. I really do not see it as a marketing company.
目前我們還有監管問題
我們的業務分佈在3萬個的城市
每個城市都有不同的法律法規
它們當中還有很多是在不同年代製成的
在你有這些技術之前
所以你必須要處理這些問題
然後還有像搜索和發現類的問題
像搜索對於谷歌這個品牌就相當重要
關於搜索
如果我有個問題
谷歌能給我4萬個搜索結果
但是它對於單個人來說
可能只有那麼一兩個是有用的
如果我想知道問題的答案
這些通常是最好的答案
我們在巴黎有4萬家房
在巴黎可能沒有滿足所有人都期待的最好的房間
這就要求我們必須十分擅長
去匹配人和技術
也就是我們也不得不成為
例如像Facebook這種數碼產品
Facebook的產品就是他們的網站
我們的產品是
讓你在真實世界中的體驗
我們不僅僅是一個線上的產品
我們也是一個線下的產品
需要你從App上轉到現實中來
這些都是一些例子解釋
技術上和設計上的問題
所以基本上說來說去就是
我們必須有世界級水平的技術
我們必須有世界級水平的設計
我們必須有世界級水平的品牌
因為我們要說服其他人
這並不瘋狂你用了不會死
我們要說服政府
這對於社區是有好處的
如果網絡進入到社區會發生什麼呢
人們就是這麼叫的這是好事希望吧
同樣你要保證我們的安全是世界級的
我們處理這些交易支付
是沒有風險問題的
我們能夠通過
這可能和文化都不相關
我甚至沒有提到文化
所以以上就是我對它的描述
我認為偉大的公司就是在任何方面
都有優勢的公司
但是你知道我們要雇傭最好的工程師
和技術天才在全世界範圍內
我完全不覺得我們是一個營銷公司
謝謝謝謝你們
好的謝謝您

Alfred Lin: Thank you.

Brian Chesky: Thank you guys.
